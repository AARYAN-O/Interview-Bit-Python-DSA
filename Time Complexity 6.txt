What is time complexity of following code :

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = N; i > 0; i /= 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }

Ans : O(N)

I think that time complexity in nested loops should be calculated on the basis of how 
many times the inner loop would run.
